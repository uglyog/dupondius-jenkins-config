<div>
    This field is optional. Specify the user name used to access the instance using
    ssh. For many Amazon AMI's this is 'ec2-user'; Ubuntu images use 'ubuntu'. If you
    don't specify this, 'root' is assumed.
    If the user does not have direct administrative
    access, i.e. is not 'root', you should also set the root command prefix, i.e. to 'sudo'.
