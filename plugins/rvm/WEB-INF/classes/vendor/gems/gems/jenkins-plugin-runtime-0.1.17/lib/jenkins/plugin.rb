  class Plugin

    # A list of all the hudson.model.Descriptor objects
    # of which this plugin is aware *indexed by Wrapper class*
    #
    # This is used so that wrappers can always have a single place
    # to go when they are asked for a descriptor. That way, wrapper
    # instances can always return the descriptor associated with
    # their class.
